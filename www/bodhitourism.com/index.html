          <h1>Welcome to Boddhi Travel!</h1>
          <p>Ladakh is a mountainous region in Jammu and Kashmir, northwest India and in the area known as the Trans-Himalaya, (the lands beyond the Himalaya: Tibet, Xinjiang and northern Pakistan). It's slightly smaller than Scotland, the settled population live between 2700 m and 4500 m, and nomadic encampments even higher, and it's the largest and the least populated region of Jammu and Kashmir. The people are a mixture of Buddhist and Muslim 50% of each. Buddhists are the majority in the east close to the Chinese border and a slight majority overall while Muslims have the majority in the north and west. Travellers are likely to see more of the Buddhists as the majority of the tourist attractions are in the east and directly related to Tibetan Buddhist culture.</p>

            <h2>Our Tours</h2>
            <p>From November to May, Ladakh is almost completely cut off from the outside world. Even in summer, getting here involves crossing the highest mountain passes in the world, or a hair-raising flight that weaves between the peaks. Isolation has preserved an almost medieval way of life, dictated by the changing seasons. However, change is coming to this mountain Shangri La. Tourism and hydro-electric power are flooding the region with money, and global warming is altering rainfall patterns, threatening farming cycles and Ladakh’s traditional mud-brick architecture.</p>

            <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
             <p>Not many hotels or guest houses existed before Ladakh was put on the international tourist map. The first few hotels in Leh town of Ladakh came up early in the year 1974, when for the first time Ladakh was thrown open to tourists from all over the world. The opening up of Ladakh for tourists also marked the entry of entrepreneurs in the field of establishment and running of hotels to cater to the ever-growing needs of the tourists. </p>

            <h2>What to Do?</h2>
              <p><b>Nubra Valley, Ladakh, India</b>
              Sometimes known as ‘Moonland’, Ladakh is bound by mountains and comprised of mountains. Human habitation is sparse, and during the wild winter months, the region is only marginally easier to reach than the moon itself. The imposing, inhospitable Nubra Valley is its wild lunar heart.</p>
